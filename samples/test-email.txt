Hi John,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our meeting last week about the Q4 financial report.

The numbers look great overall - we exceeded our targets by 15% which is fantastic news for the team. I've attached the detailed breakdown for your review.

A few highlights from the report:

1. Revenue increased 23% YoY
2. Customer acquisition cost decreased by 12%
3. Net promoter score improved to 72

Could you review sections 3 and 4 before our Thursday meeting? I'd especially appreciate your thoughts on the market expansion analysis.
